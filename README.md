# Lab | Machine Learning & AI World
Machine Learning is now one of the trending topics if you talk about technology. Everyday a lot of material about this topic arrives to the media, not only news about new discovers but also a lot of tutorials and articles about people working on this.

The objectives of this lab are:
* Get introduced into this world through the latest most important news we have had in the last few years.
* Guide you to do a deeper research to understand them better.
* Practice your presenting skills

So you will be asked to read a piece of news and then share it with your colleagues. This way, when we finish sharing, you will have a light idea of the most important events but also you will be able to dig into one specific topic a little better.

## How we will do it?

## Lightning Talks 

Lightning Talks are a popular format of presentation that aims to deliver a concise and focused message in a short span of time. They are designed to be engaging, informative, and most importantly, brief. As part of the bootcamp, you and your peers will have the chance to carry out a lightning talk on a topic if your choosing. This will allow you to carry out some additional research on an area that interests you and practice presentation skills.

## What is a Lightning Talk?

A Lightning Talk is a very short presentation that lasts only a few minutes but is aimed at quickly conveying key information or insights on a topic. It's like a snapshot of a subject, designed to grab your attention, provoke thought, all within the time it takes to drink a cup of coffee.

## Guidelines

The lightning talks will take place according to a schedule decided with your lead teacher typically right after the Lunch Hour. The length of a Lightning Talk is typically about 5 minutes. This may seem short, but you'd be surprised how much you can convey in such a small amount of time when you focus on the essentials. Keep in mind that since it is so brief, every second counts. It's crucial to use your time wisely and stick to your main points to ensure your message is delivered clearly and effectively. This quick format will push you to refine your ideas and thoughts into the most crucial and impactful points from the research you have carried out.

## Choosing a Topic

The topic for your Lightning Talk can be chosen from a predefined list, revolving around  subjects related to the curriculum, or broader topics of interest in the field. You are also encouraged to propose your own topics if there's something you would like to speak about. If you have a unique idea, concept, or area of interest that you'd like to explore and share with your peers, you are welcome to propose this as your Lightning Talk topic. The only caveat is that it should be well-researched, relevant, and feasible to present within the given time frame.

*Note: your teacher will organise how topics are distributed in case multiple students choose the same topic.*

## Summary

Lightning Talks are a unique and engaging way to learn and share knowledge. It's a fun challenge that will not only improve your presentation skills but also your ability to distil complex ideas into clear, succinct points. So, get ready to enlighten your peers with your Lightning Talk!

So let's start digging a litle bit. Imagine you open today's AI & ML journal and you see a very interesting news article. You read it but that is not enough. You want to understand:
* If it is so important as the title says (is it really a big step?) or you think it is more important than the title suggests.
* Which part of ML or AI is used and how is it related to ML or AI.
* What did they do to get the data.
* Which data did they use.
* How did they do to build the model. Which type of model is it?
* Do you know any other project that applies the same techniques? Could you use something for another use case?
* Do you find any ethical implications? Collateral effects?
* Do you know any other related news?

So you need to look for more information. Maybe the paper the scientists published, other articles, some information about the techniques, ...

Let's start! You will be assigned to an article and a day when you will have 5 minutes to share your research with your colleagues and then 5 minutes to discuss a little bit. Feel free to present your conclusions in any way you prefer.
